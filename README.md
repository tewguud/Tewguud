My name is Gabriel T and I'm a sophmore at Southwest Techincal and Career Academy. 
My interests in game development consist of learning what goes into making a video game and learning how the procces of making the games we all play today. 
A language I'am learning is French and a project that I'm doing right now is '2.2 Project Planning with A.I.' where I have to use chatgpt to help conceptualize my next game project in the class.
